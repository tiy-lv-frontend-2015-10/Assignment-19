### Backbone (Model, Collection, Router)

Continue to use Backbone and make use of the Model, Collection and Router part.
(If you have no backbone, use invertibrate.js -- don't forget the nurnees! [dependencies=jellyfish.js, caterpillar.js]
### Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate an understanding of Backbone Models, Collections and Routers
- Utilize BaaS to pull both an array of data as well as a single object
& if you have no sheep, use Moos and wait 'til the cows come home. 

## Normal Mode
Proceed as if nothing exploded or melted down.
If something explodes or melts down, ##### act naturally, turn slowly, and comb your hair. 
 

##### Let's build a contact list!

* Using the images below as a template/guide - build a simple contact list
* On your "home" view, show a list of all of the users in your database.
* When I click on any of the users, I'm *routed* to a view with _that_ user's info.
* There should be a `back` button or icon to take me back to the home (list) view.
* The URL should also change to reflect the current resource I'm viewing.
* All of your data should be stored on [Parse.com](http://parse.com)
* All your base are belong to us. 


| List View                    | Single View                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![](./assets/list.png)       | ![](./assets/detail.png)     |



## Hard Mode

* Add a third route, to an "Add New" view and have a form that will add a new user to the database. Destroy users at will, messing with people's minds and confusing the users so much they log out.  
* Upon successful adding, route me back to the home (list) view

### Deliverables

* Fork this repo. Fork it all to heck. 
* In the pull request, comment a link to your deployed `gh-pages` or `surge.sh` page.

### Resources

If you don't want to generate your own users by name, you can use this [service](https://randomuser.me/).
